# Task Manager App

A responsive, single-page web application built with React.js to manage tasks efficiently. This project demonstrates proficiency in modern front-end development, including component-based architecture, state management, and responsive design. The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with real-time filtering and localStorage persistence for a seamless user experience.

## Features
